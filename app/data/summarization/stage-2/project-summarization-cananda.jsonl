CBRE Operations to isolate each unit for service and restore when complete3 Regular hours: CBRE Operations to enable each individual chiller for the vendor to conduct operational checks. Problem identified: Tri-annual chillers service including gaskets replacement, Eddy current testing of all tubes and Inhibitor flushing.Chiller 101- Condenser vessel tube cleaning Eddy and current testing- Evaporator vessel Tube cleaning and Eddy current testing.Chiller 102- Condenser vessel tube cleaning and Eddy current testing- Evaporator vessel Tube cleaning and Eddy current testing.Chiller 103- Condenser vessel tube cleaning and Eddy current testing- Evaporator vessel Tube cleaning and Eddy current testing.. Scope includes: Ainsworth and CBRE operations to isolate one chiller at a time for service. Mechanical plant will be maintained at N+1 for the duration of the service of the three High pressure chillers.- Chillers will be isolated electrically (power) and mechanically (Valves) for both Evaporator and Condenser Vessels. Both Vessels will be drained, and End plates removed, all tubes cleaned and Eddy current performed. Once completed, End plates to both vessels will be re-installed and properly torqued, both vessels will be re-filled and inspected for leaks. Ainsworth technician to confirm chiller is fully restored and ready for service.. Justification: Tube Cleaning- Chiller efficiency is affected more by the cleanliness of heat transfer surfaces than any other single factor. Given the fact that a chiller typically can have several miles of tubing making up the condenser and evaporator, it makes sense to keep chiller tubes as clean as possible maintaining good chiller performance and efficiency.Eddy current testingCondenser & Evaporator eddy current tube analysis can identify damaged tubes before they fail, as well as good tubes that don’t need to be replaced. This process is an easy and effective way to diagnose Vessel exchanger failures.. Effect if not approved: Chillers efficiency could be affected if both Condenser and evaporator tube vessels are not serviced. Chiller efficiency and operation could be impacted due to fouling..\",\n  \"status_history\": \"First, work order closed by Sebastian Vandervort. Then, work commencement by Sebastian Vandervort.

We need to move these 3 cabinets to another pair of RPPs in order to accommodate with client expectations.. Scope includes: shift the load from RPP-1-1-A5-4 and RPP-1-1-B5-4 circuit # 7/9 and 15/17 to RPP-1-2-A2-3 and RPP-1-2-B2-3 circuit # 19/21 and 27/29 respectively. Also from RPP-1-2-A3-3 /RPP-1-2-B3-3 circuit # 8/10/12 to RPP-1-2-A3-1/ RPP-1-2-B3-1 circuit # 8/10/12 respectively. Justification: New Business Growth\n- Without moving these 6 circuits. Customers can not use these 3 cabinets for future growth\n- Customers expectation is to use these 3 cabinets at max 12 amp each which would over load current RPP source..
