The problem statement indicates: Further to our Specialist contractors engineers recent site visit, their engineer has identified that the compressor in HW4 DX3 system No.2 has failed and requires replacing. \nThe engineer also noted an issue with the \ndisplay with missing lines, which interferes with the operation of the unit and also requires replacing.. The defined scope of work includes: 1. LOTO unit\n2. Recover the refrigerant charge (record volume)\n3. Disconnect and remove the compressor (hot works)\n4. Install a new compressor (hot work)\n5. Pressure test the unit with OFN\n6. Evacuate to 4mbar\n7. Remove and install new compressor contactor\n8. Remove and install a new display\n9. Re-establish the power supply\n10. Recharge the unit T\n11.Test run the unit \n12. Check the display operation. The justification provided is: The Current Unit DX 3 in HW4, Has 2 compressors. currently Unit 2 compressor has mechanically failed, resulting in the unit not being able operate to it's  potential, to be resilient within the suite. Whilst the failure was being investigated the engineer found the display screen where you enter passwords to find the set menus to identify the operation and faults on the unit was starting to fail. without this unit operating as it should we could loose resilience within the HW4 suite which could result in hardware failing..

Pressure test system to ensure no further leaks are present\n6. Evacuate system to its suitable Torr reading and complete a vacuum rise test\n7. Charge the system with fresh R410A Refrigerant \n8. Remove isolations and test operation\n9. Update F-Gas Records if made available by site\n10. Service report to be issued upon completion of works. The justification provided is: ACU 4 provides cooling for the EPH UPS room and is currently running on one refrigerant circuit. As the room temperature will increase to higher than optimum temperature therefore leading to the possibility of the UPS system overheating and failing.. If not approved, the effect would be: ACU 4 provides cooling for the EPH UPS room and is currently running on one refrigerant circuit.

The problem statement indicates: CIO have request a Cat6a SFTP Cable to be installed from Q2C (Quote to Cash) to LAN Room 1G1 to in the Castle Area (IBM Space) at the Warwick location. This is to allow for the separation of the wifi network at Warwick between Kyndryl and IBM. The defined scope of work includes: Supply and install 1 x 100mtrs Cat6a SFTP Cable from the Q2C office (adjacent to CBRE office) to an existing Data Cabinet (TBC) located within LAN Room 1G1.\n\nThe Cat6a SFTP Cable will be installed at High level and secured where possible onto the existing cable containment infrastructure along the cable route.\nProposed cable route, from Q2C into main corridor, along corridor left into newly formed link corridor, straight down the main corridor towards the entrance passing Tape Library, HW4 and the Pantry, Turn left across Male toilet, HW1 corridor into MP14 office area and then into LAN Room 1G1.\nWe have allowed 1 x FM45/C6A Male field plug termination at the WAP module position.\nWe have allowed 1 x Female C6A termination at the Patch Panel position.\nInstallation of WAP Point to ceiling in Q2C (WAP to be provided by CIO)\nWAP to be fixed to ceiling in Q2C and cable to be dressed up to vUA switch located within the rack in LAN Room 1G1. The justification provided is: If this work is not performed then the wifi network to Q2C will be lost when the networks are split between IBM & Kyndryl. If not approved, the effect would be: As Justification - if not approved then wifi network at the location will not be able to be split between IBM & Kyndryl.\",\n  \"status_history\": \"First, billing completed by Miss Maymie Sporer.

The problem statement indicates: CCTV Camera No.10 is a legacy analogue PTZ camera which has failed and there is suspected cable damage necessitating replacement of the camera and the associated connectivity cabling.. The defined scope of work includes: Replacement and re-cabling of the existing analogue PTZ camera (Camera # 10) with an IP professional grade CCTV PTZ camera to conform with the Kyndryl CCTV technical standard and configuration of the camera onto the Milestone CCTV platform. The justification provided is: As all the CCTV cameras along the rear fence line are fixed cameras, No.10 has the ability to Pan, Tilt and  zoom to be able to follow and zoom in on situations that may arise. Replacing this camera avoids having blind spots along the perimeter fencing. A well maintained  CCTV system is essential to ensure that it is always operational and providing the best possible coverage identifying and addressing issues before they become major problems, and minimize the risk to the Kyndryl business. If not approved, the effect would be: Non replacement of camera No.10  will  leave the site  with blind spots along the rear fence and gate area..\",\n  \"status_history\": \"First, cancelled by Bilal.
