Scope includes: \u2022 No check valve is present in the fuel return line, one must be installed.o Supply and install a \u00bd\u201d check valve on the fuel return line.\u2022 Coolant is black in colour.o Coolant requires flush and install new coolant.\u2022 Cooling loop pressure gauge was at 42 psi as found, unit not running.o New cooling loop pressure gauge required, 0-60 psi gauge.\u2022 The alarm bell does not ring when alarm is active.o Supply and install a new bell required.\u2022 Front pump packing is leaking excessively.o Adjusting nuts are seized hardware will need to be replaced supply andinstall new packing utilizing fire pump specialty company Delta Arndt.CBRE hours:Qualify SOW with Engineers/Vendors, Review with client: Snr Engineer / Supervisor - 30 minutesCreate change ticket, complete scheduling, confirm security access: Snr Engineer / Supervisor - 30 minutesMonitor Work: DC Technician / Engineer\u00a0- 6 hours ( work to be completed over 8 hour day. Fire pump shutdown needed, fire monitoring throughout the day, operations to check up on vendor- complete testing at end of repairs)Verify Work Completed to SOW: Snr Engineer / Supervisor - 30 minutes (confirm all work completed, review service report). Justification: This is critical part of fire safety systems and needs to be in working order. Effect if not approved: Possible failure of fire safety systems.",
