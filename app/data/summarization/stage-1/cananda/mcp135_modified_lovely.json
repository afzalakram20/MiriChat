Scope of work includes: GXT UPS's supporting all three Chillers control panels will be replaced by DC GROUP. This replacement will take place on one chiller at a time to ensure N+1 availability. Justification: VRLA batteries in these particular modules are recommended for replacement at a range of 3 - 5 years of service, This battery system with age loses its ability to maintain greater than 80% capacity, Replacement is recommended. Effect if not approved: As these batteries age, a decline on its rating is also impacted. This decline could be a result of internal corrosion and expansion of the plate grids, possible drying of the electrolytes. Naturally the batteries no longer will support the load as per its design specs..",
