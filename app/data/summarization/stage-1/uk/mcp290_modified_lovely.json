Tower pre-disinfection will be for 1 hour, minimum \n\u2022\tABT1 & ABT2 levels are to be monitored and logged on the service report sheet. When an acceptable level has been achieved, these details are also recorded on the dynamic risk assessment service report sheet\n\u2022\tCBRE with Baltimore Air Coil technicians in attendance will then make the necessary electrical isolations as per the approved FSP\n\u2022\tCBRE with Baltimore Air Coil technicians in attendance will manually isolate the flow and return water valves positioned on the tower sump and on the return pipework on the top inspection platform. CBRE with WCS Group technicians in attendance will also isolate the Mains Water inlet valve to stop tower from filling\n\u2022\tThe Tower will then be drained to the dedicated foul drain using the drain off valve and sump pump\n\u2022\tThe faulty fan will then be stripped down and replaced with new fan shafts and bearings.\n\u2022\tOn completion of the fan repair, the other 2 fans on cooling tower 1A will be inspected for damage and where necessary, advise replacement.\n\u2022\tAfter repair to the fan has been completed on the tower, Baltimore Air Coil technicians will, where applied, remove their locks and clasps and CBRE will run the fans and make sure all is ok. Once happy the tower shall be filled back to it\u2019s appropriate levels.\n\u2022\tThe circulating water will be tested for bromine, ABT1 and ABT2 will be added to boost the level above 100ppm, the bromine level will be monitored every 15 minutes\n\u2022\tOnce acceptable the tower will be dosed with commissioning dose of inhibitor\n\u2022\tOn completion of the Tower post-disinfection CBRE will be informed so we can reinstate the electrical supply to the fans and pumps then sign off the permit to work relating to the Tower. The justification provided is: If Cooling Tower 1A - single fan is not replaced this could impact the resilience of cooling for phase 1. If not approved, the effect would be: If Cooling Tower 1A - single fan is not replaced this could impact the resilience of cooling for phase 1.",
