The problem statement indicates: CIO have requested a Cat6a SFTP Cable to be installed from RAF LITS (CMF Area) to LAN Room 1G1 to in the Castle Area (IBM Space) at the Warwick location & existing WAP in Main Reception to be moved to IRS Area (Suite 2). This is to\nallow for the separation of the wifi network at Warwick between Kyndryl and IBM.. The defined scope of work includes: Supply and install 1 x 100mtrs Cat6a SFTP Cable from an agreed position within RAF Lits (CMF) to an existing Data Cabinet (TBC) located within LAN Room 1G1.\nThe Cat6a SFTP Cable will be installed at High level and secured where possible onto\nthe existing cable containment infrastructure along the cable route.\nProposed cable route:\nFrom RAF Lits out into main corridor, along corridor left into newly formed link corridor,\nstraight down the main corridor towards the entrance passing Tape Library, HW4 and\nthe Pantry, Turn left across Male toilet, HW1 corridor into MP14 office area and then into\nLAN Room 1G1.\nWe have allowed 1 x FM45/C6A Male field plug termination at the WAP module position & 1 x Female C6A termination at the Patch Panel position.\nReception Suite 2 Data Cable installation, Supply and install 1 x 20mtr pre-term Cat6a SFTP Cable from an existing Data Network\noutlet installed within the Reception ceiling void position to an agreed position within Suite 2 foyer area.\nThe Cat6a SFTP Cable will be installed at High level and secured where possible onto\nthe existing cable containment infrastructure along the cable route.\nProposed cable route:\nFrom the Data Network outlet across the ceiling void, then into Suite2 lobby area (above\nthe false ceiling) along to an agreed position outside the data suite access doors, WAP\nunit to be mounted surface onto the ceiling tile and cable terminate directly into the WAP\nModule..\nWe have allowed 1 x 20mtr - C6A / SFTP-LSZH RJ45/s~ RJ45/s pre-term patch lead to terminate at the Data Network outlet faceplate and at the WAP module position.\nThis LSQ also includes fixing of WAPs to ceiling. The justification provided is: If this work is not performed then the wifi network to CMF will be lost when the networks are split between IBM & Kyndryl & the Reception WAP will be in a shared space. If not approved, the effect would be: As per justification - Wifi network will not be split if works not approved.",
