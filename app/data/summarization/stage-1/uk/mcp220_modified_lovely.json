The problem statement indicates: Warwick:\nThe location currently has enough fuel to provide 48 hours however the bulk tank still has the capacity for an additional 20,000 litres. As we are approaching a difficult period it has been requested to look at filling the Bulk Tank on site to provide 72 hours of run time.\n\n\nUK Sites for 2023 (Warwick & North Harbour,):\nBoth sites will require bulk fuel deliveries throughout 2023 to ensure there is sufficient runtime afforded for all generator and DRUPS employed at each location to support critical IT equipment as required..

Fuel to be transported to the location and pumped into the BST 2 Tank within the critical plant area.\n\nUK Sites for 2023 (Warwick & North Harbour):\nThis LSE will be raised to allow sites to order bulk fuel deliveries when required.. The justification provided is: Warwick:\nIf there is a prolonged outage on site this fuel delivery will assist with supporting the locations critical infrastructure for a longer period, reducing risk of outages.\n\nUK Sites for 2023 (Warwick & North Harbour):\nThis LSE will provide a more streamlined approach, will prevent hold ups when requiring additional fuel deliveries for the UK sites and will prevent additional administrative work.. If not approved, the effect would be: Warwick:\nThere would be a reduced time on what the site is capable of supplying if we were to run on Generators for prolonged periods.\n\nUK Sites for 2023 (Warwick & North Harbour):\nIf there is no fuel available systems will not continue to support critical IT equipment as required.
