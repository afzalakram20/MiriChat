The problem statement indicates: The switchroom is constructed of GRP, are 16 years old and have become brittle with fractures at high level and deterioration of seals at low level causing water ingress. The defined scope of work includes: Install measured tarpaulins across each of 2 roofs fixed to existing structures TX21-22-23. Prepare and install Hydrosil Heavy Duty Reinforcement Roll (Polyester Fabric) to internal and external low level joints and apply heavy duty Hydrosil Silicone roof coating. The justification provided is: Prevent water ingress to critical switchrooms. If not approved, the effect would be: Water ingress will remain a constant issue, a tripping hazard and possible water infiltration to HV switchgear.",
