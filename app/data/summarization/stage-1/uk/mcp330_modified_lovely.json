The problem statement indicates: CB/F32 (11kV vacuum circuit breaker) has developed a fault and will no longer operate as a functioning circuit breaker.. The defined scope of work includes: 1. CBRE to transfer critical load(s) to their alternate supplies.\n2. CBRE to isolate RMU2 from the 11kV network.\n3. 11kV Specialist to attend site and replace CB/F32.\n4. 11kV Specialist to test CB/F32 on completion.\n5. CBRE to re-instate RMU2 to the 11kV network.\n6. CBRE to restore all critical load(s) to the previous supplies.\n\nWorks to be completed in normal working hours (Mon-Fri) between 08:00 and 16:00.. The justification provided is: CB/F32 supplies Transformer6 (supply to LV1 Building Services Switchboard).\n\nWhile CB/F32 is unavailable, LV1 Building Services Switchboard is reduced to 1x supply (from Transformer12).\n\nReplacement of CB/F32 will restore the 2nd supply to LV1 Switchboard and subsequently restore the site electrical distribution system to it's designed capability.. If not approved, the effect would be: LV1 Building Services Switchboard will remain at risk with only 1x supply available (from Transformer12)..",
