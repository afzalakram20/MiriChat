        "problem": "As part of the shutting down of the IRS space at Kyndryl Warwick, during investigative works to safely plan the removal of redundant server racks from HW1, it was discovered the safest route would be to go through the double doors leading from reception into the corridor. \n\nWith the door fittings and swing arms in place attempting to remove the racks via this route would cause damage to the fittings on the door, making the door inoperable. Removing the fittings from the doors would allow the racks to pass under without causing damage.",

Following removal of all racks from HW1 the contractor will re-attend the Warwick site  same day to re-assemble and commission ensuring both doors open and close as they should.",
