Customer complaint of several issues:\n\nHMI screen locked up and couldn’t be restarted\nG2 is in shutdown, no indication due to HMI not working\nG2 was showing breaker open status and will not start when requested.\n\n\n\nPerform initial inspection. Find that HMI computer is running and display is active. Close out factory talk launcher and ensure that runtime file is located on machine. Re-launch factorytalk and load application. When application is loaded, run program and ensure that program is communicating, all displays are functional. Verify that shutdown was caused by synchronizing controller shutdown command. Verify that HMI shows status of 52-G2 as open. Go to generator to verify that breaker is closed. Inspect wiring in EMCP panel and find no issues. Remove wiring from CB-AUX contacts and open and close breaker to ensure signal is present. Re-install interconnect wiring and move to switchgear cell for G2. Locate interconnect terminal at 3T3-10. Locate I\/O input as Card 5, slot 4, Input 7. When terminal driver pushes against terminal, status light on I\/O card activates, and when released, input deactivates. Remove wire from generator side of terminal and inspect. No issues found and re-install and tighten. Input still not active. Remove wire on PLC side of terminal. Inspect wire and terminal. Suspect that ferrule on wire was being pinched above the tube, on the plastic, and was making incidental contact with the terminal. Re-installed wire and torqued connections. Verify that status of breaker was now active, and moving wire or terminal doesn’t affect the signal as previous. This is the root cause of failure for why the generator didn’t start when requested. PLC logic will prevent start of generator in automatic if 52-G2 is shown as open, and due to bad connection, PLC logic was given a false status even though breaker was physically closed. Connected to the ComAp controller to gather history log and ensure no further issues other than generator didn’t start and shutdown caused by it not seeing generator voltage. Once this was confirmed, placed ECS in off and reset shutdown for G2. Placed ECS back in automatic. Customer now activated transfer at ATS#10. All three generators started. G3 closed breaker first, then G2, then after some delay, approximately 3 minutes, G1 closed the breaker. Some concern with length of time to synchronize breaker, but with the knowledge that ComAP controllers are limited in PID functionality, some trade off must be made for performance vs. stability vs. Load sharing acceptance on transients. Returned system to normal and generators opened breakers and shutdown accordingly. Informed customer of all findings and no further issues present at this time. All units back in operational state.",
