This can result in water leaking from the cooling tower or biological contaminants entering the system.\nEquipment damage: Corrosion can cause serious damage to a cooling tower’s equipment, leading to costly downtime and repair and replacement fees.",
        "non_approval_effect": "Corrosion is the breakdown of metal and naturally occurs when a metal comes into contact with water. In cooling tower systems, the chance of corrosion is particularly high due to the chemicals used in water treatment and the high concentration of electrolytes in the water due to evaporation. Additionally, water corrosivity increases with high conductivity in cooling tower water since corrosion is an electrochemical process by nature.\n\nCorrosion can cause serious problems in a cooling tower, including:\n\nDebris: Corrosion can result in metal debris entering the water system, contaminating the water, blocking pipes and causing inefficient cooling processes. \nLeaks: Corroded metal can create small holes within the system, exposing the closed water system to the outside. This can result in water leaking from the cooling tower or biological contaminants entering the system.\nEquipment damage: Corrosion can cause serious damage to a cooling tower’s equipment, leading to costly downtime and repair and replacement fees."
