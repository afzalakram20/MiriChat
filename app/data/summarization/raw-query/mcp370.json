On checking STS log, CPU had rebooted successfully and the STS and hardwire alarm could be reset. Follow up functional test completed, preferred source to standby and back again was completed 29th April with Piller UK in attendance. On further checks with Piller it was confirmed that there have been failures of the main A100 CPU board due to leaking capacitors on units > 10 years old, including one at NHBR during the 2024 maintenance.
